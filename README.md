# VBA-challenge

# Overview

I followed the provided instructions to create a VBA script that analyses stock data. 

The script accomplishes the following tasks:
1) Loops through all the stocks for one year on each worksheet.
2) Outputs the following information for each stock:
  - Ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price to the closing price.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
3) Adds functionality to the script to determine and return the stock with the "Greatest % increase," "Greatest % decrease," and "Greatest total volume."
4) Ensures that the script can run on every worksheet, allowing it to process data for multiple years simultaneously.
